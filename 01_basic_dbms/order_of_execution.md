## 🧠 SQL Query Execution Order (NOT left to right!)

### Even though we write:
```sql
SELECT column
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column;
```

### ✅ Internally SQL runs in this logical **execution order**:

| Step | Clause        | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣   | `FROM`        | Finds the source table(s) |
| 2️⃣   | `JOIN`        | Joins tables if any |
| 3️⃣   | `WHERE`       | Filters rows (before grouping) |
| 4️⃣   | `GROUP BY`    | Groups filtered rows |
| 5️⃣   | `HAVING`      | Filters groups |
| 6️⃣   | `SELECT`      | Selects/derives output columns |
| 7️⃣   | `DISTINCT`    | Removes duplicates |
| 8️⃣   | `ORDER BY`    | Sorts the final result |
| 9️⃣   | `LIMIT`       | Limits number of rows |

### 🔍 Example:

```sql
SELECT dep_id, COUNT(*) as total_students
FROM student
WHERE dob >= '2000-01-01'
GROUP BY dep_id
HAVING total_students > 5
ORDER BY total_students DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 🔄 Internally, SQL engine runs it in this order:

1. `FROM student`
2. `WHERE dob >= '2000-01-01'`
3. `GROUP BY dep_id`
4. `HAVING total_students > 5`
5. `SELECT dep_id, COUNT(*) as total_students`
6. `ORDER BY total_students DESC`
7. `LIMIT 3`

## 🧠 Interview Insight:

> **Q: Why is `WHERE` before `SELECT`?**

Because the DB engine first needs to know **what data to filter**, before it knows **what columns to return**.

> **Q: Why can't we use aliases in WHERE but can in HAVING?**  
Because `WHERE` runs **before `SELECT`**, so the alias doesn't exist yet. But `HAVING` runs **after `SELECT`**, so the alias is available.
