| Feature               | **View** üü¢                                                                           | **CTE (Common Table Expression)** üîµ                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | A *named, permanent* query stored in the database schema.                             | A *temporary, inline* query defined with `WITH` inside a single SQL statement.     |
| **Lifetime**          | Persists until explicitly dropped using `DROP VIEW`.                                  | Exists only for the duration of that query execution.                              |
| **Storage**           | Stores only the query definition (not the data).                                      | Exists only in memory during query execution.                                      |
| **Reusability**       | Can be reused in multiple queries across the database.                                | Can be reused **only within the same query**.                                      |
| **Updatability**      | Can be *updatable* if simple (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE allowed).                        | Not updatable (read-only).                                                         |
| **Security**          | Can hide sensitive columns by exposing only needed fields.                            | No security benefits.                                                              |
| **Performance**       | Similar to underlying query; acts like a saved query.                                 | Expanded inline; before MySQL 8.0.13, always materialized (slower).                |
| **Recursion Support** | ‚ùå Not supported.                                                                      | ‚úÖ Supports recursion (e.g., hierarchical data queries).                            |
| **Use Case**          | Simplify complex queries for repeated use, enforce security.                          | Simplify subqueries, recursive queries, or break down complex queries temporarily. |
| **Dependency**        | Stored in database, depends on underlying tables (becomes invalid if tables dropped). | Self-contained, no permanent dependency after query finishes.                      |

‚úÖ **Interview one-liner**:
*A View is like a permanent reusable virtual table, while a CTE is like a temporary throwaway view that only lives inside a single query ‚Äî but CTEs can do recursion, which Views cannot.*
