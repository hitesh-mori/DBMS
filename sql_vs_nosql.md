# SQL vs NoSQL: A Comprehensive Comparison

| Feature          | SQL Database                                      | NoSQL Database                                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | SQL databases are primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases. | NoSQL databases are primarily called Non-relational or distributed databases. |
| **Query Language** | Uses Structured Query Language (SQL). | No declarative query language; varies by database type. |
| **Type**        | Table-based databases.                            | Can be document-based, key-value pairs, or graph databases. |
| **Examples**    | MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL.                | MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, Cassandra, HBase.            |
| **Schema**      | Predefined schema; follows strict structure.      | Uses dynamic schema for unstructured data.          |
| **Scalability** | Vertically scalable (adding more power to a single server). | Horizontally scalable (adding more machines to the system). |
| **ACID vs CAP** | ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance ensures data integrity. | Follows CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance). |
| **Best Suited For** | Complex, query-intensive environments requiring high data integrity. | Use cases with high scalability needs and flexible data structures. |
| **Importance**  | Ideal when data validity and consistency are critical. | Preferable when speed and flexibility are more important than data accuracy. |

## Additional Interview Insights:

- **When to choose SQL?**
  - When data integrity, relationships, and structured data storage are key.
  - Suitable for financial systems, healthcare records, and enterprise applications.

- **When to choose NoSQL?**
  - When dealing with large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data.
  - Best for real-time big data applications, IoT, and social media analytics.

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - SQL databases perform better for complex queries and transactions.
  - NoSQL databases excel in high-speed read/write operations for large datasets.

- **Hybrid Approaches:**
  - Some modern databases, like PostgreSQL, offer both SQL and NoSQL capabilities.
